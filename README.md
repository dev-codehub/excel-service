# Excel Service

A Java library to create Excel workbooks dynamically, with a single line of code you can create an Excel workbook.

Now you ask: "**That's impossible, I spend so much time and need huge amounts of code to generate an Excel!**"

Correction, you needed it, from now on it won't happen again.
